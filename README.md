**My reflection:**

The visit to UTM Digital's open day has exposed me the real technologies applied in the industry. Then, it had also given me a thorough understanding of the theory we have learnt in class by relating it to its practical uses, via the technologies demonstrated in the UTM Digital Open Day. Last and foremost, the talk that we have attended intrigued my interest towards a system's efficiency especially about the UTM Portal and UTM Smart, hence it has motivated me more to learn more about this career.
