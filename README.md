**My reflection:**

The visit to UTM Digital's open day has exposed me the real technologies applied in the industry. Then, it had also given me a thorough understanding of the theory we have learnt in class by relating it to its practical uses, via the technologies demonstrated in the UTM Digital Open Day. Last and foremost, the talk that we have attended intrigued my interest towards a system's efficiency especially about the UTM Portal and UTM Smart, hence it has motivated me more to learn more about this career.

### **Assignment 3:** Academic Writing about Project Management dan System Development
**PDF file:** (Refer *Academic Writing Group 3.pdf*)

**My reflection:**

Upon listening to the speaker’s sharing on SDLC and the whole PM process, it has now made clear for us students to understand that no matter the difference of our courses in the Computer Science field in university, Project Management applies to everyone in their career in the future to ensure that a high quality project can be produced with systematic contributions within the team.

**PDF file:** (Refer *Group 3 - Newsletter.pdf*)

**My reflection:**

The industrial visit to Johor Port shifted my perspective on what it means to be an ICT professional. Beyond the hardware and code, I saw how innovation is used to solve human problems by reducing the possibility for error in dangerous environments and saving valuable time for workers. It was inspiring to see how ICT serves the wider community, which is by keeping the port efficient, these tech solutions ensure that essential goods reach people without delay. Hence, I am motivated to use my skills to create technology that also simultaneously improves daily life and safety for others.

## PC Assemble Lab
**Hands-on activity assembling and understanding computer hardware components.**
![4393](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bb9ece9-3b7a-4743-bdc4-df415f193cc2)

**What I have gained:**
I've only had a brief knowledge about PC assembling before attending this session, and definitely I have never had the opportunity to assemble the main parts hands-on. But after attending this session, I've now gained a thorough understanding about the PC assembling process in more detail. My group faced a bit of a problem while we were attempting to run the PC upon building it from scratch. Thankfully, it managed to turn on smoothly afterwards. 

**Suggest any improvement:**
To improve the PC Assemble Lab session, we should focus on having more time to learn each parts of the PC in more detail hands-on. Hence, it will be more interesting and engaging for students.

**Others:**
This experience could be more engaging by introducing a new challenge where teams that complete early are tasked with an extra project. For example, they could take have us disassemble another set of newer PCs for each team and assemble them back again so we can analyze and compare the difference between old and new PCs. Not only this challenges the students more, but it could help pique the students' interest in this matter.

**Prototype:** [Prototype](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG91kaOGuI/Imitl1dnm0RPEhs_5qXq7A/edit?utm_content=DAG91kaOGuI&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

**Video:** [DESIGN THINKING](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG913I3r7w/lwR0G6pVYrpe7dSxSTRHCg/edit)

**My reflection:**
In the future, I would like to take part in projects that require designing and developing a system while being in an IT career. From this design thinking project, I am exposed to the brief process of developing a system whether from front-end or back-end systems, thus I have taken note of the complex challenges that I will face in the future. Hence, the vital steps that I should implement to increment my potential in the industry are to continue gaining more knowledge and experience in programming, technical, system designing and graphic designing skills.
